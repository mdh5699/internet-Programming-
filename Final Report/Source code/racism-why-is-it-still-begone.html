    <h2><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">Not all blacks are equal </font></h2> . <p><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black"> Moreover American society is a polyglot mixture where cultural dynamics influence one another. For example, some middle class, suburban white kids download rap music produced by black artists from the inner city. These musicians come to have a market substantially influenced by the preferences of their middle-class white customers. To a certain degree, they play to that audience, including that audience’s stereotypes about thuggish behavior. Along comes a schoolteacher who announces: Rap music is bad, and it’s pathological. Can’t you see just how troubled black people are? This is ludicrous. How is it that a few hundred musicians and artists responding to a national market consisting mostly of white customers suddenly become emblematic of black culture or black people?Another example involves the drug trade, which in the U.S. is worth billions of dollars annually and includes marijuana, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, and crystal meth.</font></p>
<p><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black"> It involves people of every race in every geographic location and every walk of life. But the street trafficking in drugs in large urban areas is largely in the hands of black and Latino youth in substantial part because the only people who would do such dangerous, low-paying work are those whose alternative employment opportunities are scant. It is no surprise that those incarcerated for street-level trafficking are disproportionately blacks. Their arrests and imprisonment are not in themselves evidence of racism or evidence of black culture. But given the bare facts of racial stigma in American society, many observers will be inclined to think so.Another example involves the drug trade, which in the U.S. is worth billions of dollars annually and includes marijuana, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, and crystal meth.

    <h2><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black"> No Responsibility</font></h2> <p> <font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">If the negative cultural patterns in some African-American communities are said to be a necessary consequence of oppression, what is one to make of positive cultural patterns of behavior? Are they, too, a necessary consequence of oppression? If an individual or a community refuses to take responsibility for failure, how can they claim any glory for success? No blame? No skin in the game? Then no credit.</font></p>
<p><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">You cannot help the hand you are dealt; but you can decide how to play it. To cast oneself as a helpless victim, to filter experience constantly and at every instance through a sieve that catches everything that one has control over while leaving the outcome to invisible, implacable historical forces: something is pathetic about that posture.</font></p>
<p><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">The struggle for equal rights for black people, from abolition through the civil rights movement, has always been thought of as a “freedom struggle.” But with freedom, rightly understood, comes responsibility. It is past time for all of us to start performing without a net. Rather than lamenting the lack of black billionaires, an outcome ascribed to some invisible force called “racism,” one can admit that you will never become a billionaire unless you build a billion-dollar business which begins by starting a business. One will never win a Nobel Prize in physics unless one learns calculus at the age of 12. What black parents are insisting that their 12-year-old kids learn calculus those few kids capable of doing so? White people are not responsible for the fact that black people are, or are not, doing this.</font></p>

 <h2><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">Reward bias</font></h2> <p><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black"> Reward bias is grounded in racially discriminatory transactions, but development bias is ultimately rooted in racially stigmatized social relations. Many resources that foster human development only become available to persons as the by-product of informal, race-influenced social interactions. Another way to put this expanded view of discrimination: reward bias reflects discrimination in contract while development bias reflects discrimination in contact.</font></p>

<h2><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">Categorization</font></h2><p> <font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">Categorization: what is it? For us the word  race refers to indelible and heritable marks on human bodies skin color, hair texture, bone structure. That are of no intrinsic significance but that nevertheless have,through time, come to be invested with social expectations that are more or less reasonable and social meanings that are more or less durable. When we talk about race in America or anywhere else, we are actually dealing with two distinct processes: categorization and signification. Categorization entails sorting people into a small number of subsets based on bodily marks and differentiating one’s dealings with such persons accordingly. It is a cognitive act and an effort to comprehend the social world around us.</font></p>
