    <p><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">Black Lives Matter is a decentralized political and social movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against black people. It matters because most people see it has a hash tag or slogan. At its core, Black Lives Matter opposes the systemic racism that has existed in the United States for centuries. Even though slavery has been abolished and Blacks now have the same rights as whites, racial abuses still exist, as evidenced by the number of unarmed Black men and women killed by White police officers. Undoubtedly, the BLM movement has been effective in helping victims of gun violence and police brutality. For instance, the movement has raised visibility for non-profit organizations like Wheelchairs Against Guns, which is also committed to stemming the tide of gun violence and police brutality in the Black community. </font></p>

    <center><p>
        <font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">Defund the police” means reallocating or redirecting funding away from the police department to other government agencies funded by the local municipality. That’s it. It’s that simple. Defund does not mean abolish policing. And, even some who say abolish, do not necessarily mean to do away with law enforcement altogether. Rather, they want to see the rotten trees of policing chopped down and fresh roots replanted anew. Camden, New Jersey, is a good example. Nearly a decade ago, Camden disbanded (abolished) its police force and dissolved the local police union. This approach seems to be what Minneapolis will do in some form, though the nuances are important.
Different from abolishing and starting anew, defunding police highlights fiscal responsibility, advocates for a market-driven approach to taxpayer money, and has some potential benefits that will reduce police violence and crime. Below, I outline some of the main arguments for defunding the police.
