With 2020 more than halfway over, 
there are countless challenges that social workers are currently facing.
 For many, it might feel like there are still more concerns to come. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a historic economic downturn leaving millions unemployed, 
and Black Lives Matter protests have reignited discussions about systemic racism, inequality as well as police reform. 
In addition to the topics that dominate the headlines, long-term issues such as food insecurity and climate justice are still ongoing. 
The list of social issues in the U.S. and around the globe in 2020 can seem overwhelming.

    Exercising your right to vote is one of the biggest social justice issues prioritized by the National Association of Social Workers. They’re  goal is twofold and  encourages  who can vote to please exercise their right and work to eliminate barriers to participation. As the 2020 presidential election approaches, NASW is hosting webinars on engaging millennials to vote and on understanding the barriers that can hold back low-income individuals, college students, senior citizens, minorities and many others. These obstacles can include difficult voter registration, shortened early voting windows and stricter identification requirements.</font>

        Social work and healthcare are intrinsically tied together. There are a number of challenges when it comes to receiving quality healthcare, particularly in the U.S. Despite the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, gaps in coverage remain, particularly with mental health resources. The U.S. spends more on healthcare for individuals than any other country, but that increase in expenditure has not translated to higher life expectancies for Americans. Social workers offer support to individuals, groups and entire communities, so it matters whether one person is struggling or whether an entire community is struggling to find the care they need. This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown just how vital access to healthcare really is as many communities struggle to access tests, treatment and mental health professionals.</font>

            Racism has a long history in the United States, and its impact can be found in every facet of education, business, media and day-to-day life. After the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota and several other high-profile police shootings, Black Lives Matter protests took place across the country and have continued as activists demand substantial change. Many social workers are all too aware of the devastating and long-term consequences of racial injustice on the mental and physical health of individuals, and more recently, the NASW has vocalized its support for federal legislation that would enact police reform and address systemic racism within the criminal justice system.</font> </center></p>

        A recent federal report found that in the 2018 America’s income gap was the largest it has ever been in 50 years. Following the pandemic that divide will most likely be much lager. Day to day workers play a critical role in helping those struggling.Disparities also can be a factor at play. Based on race, gender, and sexuality. Even in the working field the gender pay gap exists.  Where there is an significant difference in how men and women are being payed for the same work. </font>

        It’s something stated in NASW’s Code of Ethics, but ensuring equality is an essential part of a social worker’s role. It’s an issue that pervades nearly all of the issues already presented—whether it’s related to finances or access to resources. It’s also become painfully more relevant as the COVID-19 pandemic impacts marginalized communities at higher rates both economically and medically Obtaining equality in America is a big picture issue that social workers have been and will continue to be dedicated to addressing.</font>
