    <header><h1><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">Racism in education</font></h1></header></center>
    <p><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">Throughout the twentieth century, school desegregation has been one of the most divisive issues in the United States. Cities such as Little Rock, Boston, and Detroit saw massive resistance to integration in the form of violence, riots, and boycotts, and many white families chose to leave their home communities in order to avoid the prospects of integration.</font></p>
<h2>Brief History of desegregation effortsIn</h2> <p><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">1954, the U.S. Supreme Court passed down a unanimous decision, proclaiming that separate schools were inherently unequal, and district courts must carry out school integrations with all deliberate speed. Yet despite this ruling, many cities and states around the nation ignored Brown v. Board’s implications</font> </p>
<p><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">Today, institutionalized school segregation still persists, as laws have not been enough to rectify the ways in which minorities are disadvantaged through social and political systems. According to a study from the U.S. Government Accountability Office  conducted between the 2000–2001 and 2013–2014 school years, the percentage of racially or socioeconomically isolated schools—with 75 percent or more of their students belonging to one race or socioeconomic class—increased from 9 percent to 16 percent. What’s even more of a cause for concern is that these schools—compared to schools that were not isolated—offered fewer math, science, and college preparatory classes and had more students held back a grade, adding to the already existing achievement gap for poor, African-American, and Latino students.</font></p>
<h2><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">Academics</font></h2><p><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">The idea that success comes primarily from hard work minimizes systemic problems many Black children face.</font></p>
<p><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">Discrimination and racial bias against Black students begins as early as preschool. Several studies bear this out, including one from last year, in which researchers reported that teachers asked to rate students’ academic abilities scored Black children far below white peers with identical scores. Such implicit bias can have serious negative consequences: Teachers tasked with recommending students for gifted and talented programs, for example, might overlook Black students who would excel. In Seattle, the Black-white divide in such programs is among the nation’s largest.</font></p>
 
<h2><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">Discipline</font></h2><p><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">Zero tolerance discipline policies, like mandatory suspensions or expulsions for offenses that don’t include violence or drugs, fuel the school-to-prison pipeline. Such policies fall hardest on Black students: In the 2015-16 school year, for instance, Black students nationwide made up about 15 percent of public school students but 31 percent of those referred to police or arrested at school. In Seattle Public Schools last year, Black students made up half of police referrals, but only 14% of the district’s enrollment.</font></p>
 
                                       
<h2><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">Higher Education</font></h2><p><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">Black students face significant barriers that keep them from enrolling in college and ultimately earning a degree. It starts with their K-12 education: If schools fail to prepare them early on, they’re more likely to struggle to get in or possess study habits that allow them to persist and earn a degree. Students who go to school in low-income neighborhoods might not have the standardized test scores required for admission.</font></p>
<p><font size="5" face="georgia" color="black">Black college students face hurdles once they enroll. Some highly selective schools use test scores for admission to certain majors, such as those in the STEM fields, which works to systemically keep out many Black students. Many predominantly white institutions also have a history and culture that makes Black students feel unwelcome. </font></p>
